# Deepfake-Detection-with-XAI
This project implements a deepfake detection system using deep learning (ResNet34) combined with explainability techniques to improve model transparency. The goal is to distinguish between real and fake face images with high accuracy and provide visual explanations for the modelâ€™s predictions.
